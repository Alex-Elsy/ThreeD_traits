### Trait correlations

The trait correlation is high between the size traits (area, height and dry mass).

```{r}
#| label: trait-correlation
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Correlations between traits.

tar_load(trait_correlation_plot)

trait_correlation_plot

```



### Trait coverage

The trait correlation is high between the size traits (area, height and dry mass).

```{r}
#| label: trait-coverage
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: The proportions of the level traits were imputed from before the bootstrapping procedure; plot (blue), block (green), site (orange) or global (red).

tar_load(imputation_plot)
